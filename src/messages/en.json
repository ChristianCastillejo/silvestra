        "paragraph1": "Think of it as a miniature tropical greenhouse. Inside the glass we've created the perfect balance between plants, substrate and moisture. The heat of the day evaporates the water, which condenses on the walls and falls back at night like an internal \"rain\".",

        "listItem1": "Absence of condensation: If in the morning you don't see droplets of condensation on the glass.",
        "listItem2": "Dry moss: If the moss has lost its intense green color and feels rough to the touch.",
        "listItem3": "Light soil: If the substrate stuck to the glass looks light brown (dry) instead of dark (wet).",
        "paragraph2": "How to water correctly: Don't use a watering can. Use a sprayer or a syringe.",
        "listItem4": "1. Pour or spray mineral (or filtered) water very slowly, aiming at the base of the plants and the moss, not just the leaves.",
        "listItem5": "2. Do it little by little. It's much easier to add water than to remove it.",
        "listItem6": "3. Stop when you see the substrate change color to dark, without flooding the bottom."

      "light": {
        "tabTitle": "☀️ Light",
        "title": "Light: The Engine of Life",
        "paragraph1": "The Golden Rule: Lots of brightness, zero direct sun. The moss and tropical plants in your terrarium evolved to grow under the tree canopy, where light arrives filtered.",
        "listItem1": "Where to put it? Near a window, but never where the sun's rays hit it directly. The glass would act like a magnifying glass and \"cook\" the plants in a matter of hours.",
        "listItem2": "The Pro Trick: Rotate the terrarium 180° every week. This will prevent the plants from growing tilted seeking light and ensure the moss stays green on all sides."

      "troubleshooting": {
        "tabTitle": "🚑 Troubleshooting",
        "title": "Troubleshooting",
        "paragraph1": "Too much condensation? If the glass is so fogged that you can't see the plants inside, the terrarium has excess heat or humidity.",
        "listItem1": "Solution: Open the lid for 12-24 hours so the excess water evaporates. Look for a slightly cooler place if possible.",
        "paragraph2": "Yellow or fallen leaves? It's normal for plants to lose some old leaves (the bottom ones) to give strength to the new ones. It's part of their natural cycle.",
        "listItem2": "Solution: Open the terrarium and remove dead leaves with long tweezers or by hand. If they stay inside, they could generate mold.",
        "paragraph3": "White and hairy mold? Sometimes, during adaptation to your home, a bit of mold may appear on a branch or in the substrate. Don't panic.",
        "listItem3": "Solution: Remove the affected part with a paper towel or a cotton swab. Leave the terrarium open for 48 hours in a well-lit place. Light and fresh air are the best natural fungicides.",
        "paragraph4": "Bugs? Your ecosystem is alive. Some earthworm or small soil insect is a sign of healthy substrate. If you see snails or slugs, remove them so they don't eat your plants. If you see pests (white aphids), contact us and we'll tell you how to treat it, although it's very uncommon in closed terrariums.",
